# Eurorack Case

This is an 84HP 6U eurorack case which can be laser cut from 3mm thick materials such as plywood. It's a version of [this studio case by Nonlinearcircuits](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1206118), modified to be cut from thinner material. This is entirely motivated by the materials available for laser cutting at my local library, and if you have access to thicker materials you should probably use the original design.

## TODO

- Adjust the design to include mounting holes and cutout for Doepfer A-100 DIY Kit #1 power supply
- Actually cut and assemble the case
- Take photos and include them in this repository
